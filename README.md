## boiler-plate project structure for react development.

1. **npm install**  
this will create the node_modules folder to be shared with each project.

2. use directory named *project1* as boiler-plate for each project.

3. modify *package.json* for each project to match the dependencies and devDependencies.

4. run **webpack** to bundle and start development.
