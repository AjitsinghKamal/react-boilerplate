## boiler-plate project structure for react development.

1. **npm install**  
this will create the node_modules folder to be shared with each project.

2. use sub-dir named project-1 as boiler-plate for each project.

3. modify *package.json* for each project to match the dependencies. 

4. **webpack** to bundle and start development.
